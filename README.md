# Internet-CalC
**Well refined and Compactable IP Calculator for IP RANGE, CIDR, HEX, BINARY, DEC**
---

This lightweight Python utility offers a simple command-line interface for working with IP addresses and networks. It lets you seamlessly convert IPs between standard decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats, as well as handle CIDR notation. The tool can expand CIDR blocks into their full IP ranges and calculate the smallest possible CIDR block that contains a specified IP range.

## Features
- Convert IP addresses to hexadecimal format.
- Convert IP addresses to binary format.
- Convert binary IP addresses back to decimal format.
- Convert hexadecimal IP addresses back to decimal format.
- Convert CIDR notation to IP range.
- Convert an IP range to the smallest possible CIDR block that covers the entire range.

## Usage
Run the script in your terminal, and you will be presented with a menu of options:

Menu:
1. Convert IP to HEX
2. Convert IP to Binary
3. Convert Binary to IP
4. Convert HEX to IP
5. Convert CIDR to IP Range
6. Convert IP Range to the smallest CIDR block
7. Exit

Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform and follow the prompts.
